# Breakout Game

## Profiling

- Game performance
- Code performance


Understanding how each implementation is compiled and how that affects
performance.

Things to measure?

- game loop?
- update function?
- render function?



TODO:

- [] move implementations of game to repo
- [] run instance of each game inside a puppeteer
- [] print the results and see what sticks out
- [] post on zulip
